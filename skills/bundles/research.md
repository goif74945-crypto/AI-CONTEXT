# AI-CONTEXT Skill Bundle: research

## Operational Definition
These are executable Skill definitions, not capability names. The Registry uses each `SKILL:<ID>` locator to load the exact procedure.

## SKILL:RESEARCH-001
### Identity
- id: RESEARCH-001
- name: deep-research
- version: 1.1.0
- status: MATERIALIZED
- locator: SKILL:RESEARCH-001

### Objective
Perform structured source discovery, evidence extraction, cross-checking and synthesis.

### Required Inputs
- task
- current_context
- authority
- scope
- expected_output
- validation_requirements

### Dependencies
- CORE-001
- CORE-004
- CORE-005

### Execution Algorithm
1. Define research question.
2. Search authoritative sources.
3. Extract evidence.
4. Cross-check.
5. Synthesize with provenance.

### Decision Rules
- Authoritative current evidence outranks secondary summaries.
- Missing evidence is UNKNOWN, not permission to infer.
- Requirements and scope are immutable unless explicitly changed by authorized input.
- Dependency failure blocks dependent execution unless a declared safe recovery exists.
- Identical task/context/registry/authority must yield the same decision class.

### Edge Cases
- Missing required input → BLOCKED and identify the field.
- Critical source conflict → FREEZE and expose both sources.
- Stale evidence → do not silently treat as current.
- Partial result → PARTIAL or NOT VERIFIED.
- Tool unavailable → UNKNOWN; never fabricate the result.
- Mid-run scope change → stop and re-audit.

### Evidence Contract
For each material conclusion record:
1. evidence type;
2. source/artifact;
3. exact locator when available;
4. observed result;
5. requirement/decision supported;
6. limitations and unknowns.

### Output Contract
Return:
- status: READY | RUNNING | PASS | PARTIAL | NOT VERIFIED | BLOCKED | FAIL | FREEZE
- actions
- outputs
- evidence
- errors
- unknowns
- remaining
- next_gate

### Validation Gates
- Registry identity matches.
- Dependencies resolve and are acyclic.
- Authority and scope are valid.
- Algorithm steps are completed or explicitly marked incomplete.
- Output contract is satisfied.
- Evidence supports the claimed status.
- No forbidden behavior occurred.

### Forbidden
- fabricated evidence;
- invented repository/system state;
- placeholder presented as implementation;
- unsupported PASS/VERIFIED;
- silent requirement change;
- destructive action outside authority.

### Stop Conditions
Authority conflict, unresolved critical contradiction, missing dependency, permission violation, integrity failure, or impossible validation requirement.
