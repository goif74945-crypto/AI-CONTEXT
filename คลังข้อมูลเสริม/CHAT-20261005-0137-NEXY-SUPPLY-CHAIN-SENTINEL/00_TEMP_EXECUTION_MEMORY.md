## Current verified local state
- AI-CONTEXT bootstrap/kernel/router/rules loaded.
- NEXY.AI overview loaded from AI-CONTEXT only.
- Existing supplemental folder names scanned.
- Searches for `dependency drift`, `supply chain`, `SBOM`, `package provenance`, `lockfile integrity` returned no matches in AI-CONTEXT at inspection time.
- Selected and implemented project: NEXY Supply-Chain Sentinel (NSCS).
- TDD evidence includes initial RED, adversarial REDs, fixes, and final regression.
- Final regression: 19/19 tests PASS under `python -W error`.
- Static compile: PASS.
- CLI subprocess integration: strict version drift FREEZE; explicit policy version drift ALLOW; hashed Python requirement ALLOW.
- Performance smoke: 10,000 package inventory completed deterministically in the local execution environment; informational only, not an SLA.

## Invariants
1. Additive-only inside unique supplemental folder.
2. No write to any NEXY.AI-named repository.
3. No secrets.
4. Deterministic output for identical normalized inputs.
5. Ambiguous/unsupported dependency evidence causes FREEZE, never silent acceptance.
6. Design proposals must be labeled as proposals, not current NEXY.AI requirements.
7. Completion requires executed tests plus post-write GitHub readback.
8. Never force-update the branch; rebase/rebuild the additive commit on latest HEAD if concurrent writers move main.

## Resume point
Local implementation is complete and tested. Next action: lock latest AI-CONTEXT `main`, atomically add the unique folder, then perform GitHub readback/content-integrity verification and write a final evidence record.
